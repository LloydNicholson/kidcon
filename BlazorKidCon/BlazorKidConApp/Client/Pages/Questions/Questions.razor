        <h2>ADELIC PRINCIPLE CLASSIFICATION</h2>
        <p>
            Using ADELIC is a skill. It should be used as a guideline or map.
            The principle is used to find the correct side that an account increases or decreases.
            Make sure you know your account names and each of their classifications.
            Once you know each of these, the ADELIC principle becomes easy to use.
            Identifying which side each of these different accounts increase on will make your general ledger, trial balance and accounting equation transactions easier.
