            <p class="body-paragraph">Using ADELIC is a skill. It should be used as guideline or map used to find the
                correct side that an account increases or decreases. Make sure you know your account names and each of
                their classifications. Once you know each of these, the ADELIC principle becomes easy to use.
                Identifying which side each of these different accounts increase on will make your general ledger, trial
                balance and accounting equation transactions easier.</p>
